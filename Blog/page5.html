        <h4>
    When entering the Matthew Marks gallery, located in 522 West 22nd St., a total of 3 large-scale sculptural pieces fill the space; the black surface and geometric form characterize these monumental works. However, Tony Smith’s Wall produced in 1964 embodies the main concern of this paper.  
	Encompassing 8 feet in height, 18 feet in length and 2 feet in width Wall surpasses, as points of reference, the height of an average male, which is 5 feet 9 inches and represents the equivalent length of an average SUV, which is 18 feet. As further part of the technical data, the solid is most likely created by pouring a melted material, in this case steel, into a mold. Although the sculpture’s general condition seems to be smooth and undamaged, the edges and corners are in fact worn and blunt. Furthermore, even though the discussed art piece is displayed as part of a complex sculptural setting, this rectangular prism stands by itself on the concrete floor beneath alone in the right end of the room. 
In terms of subject matter, this sleek mass adopts a representational figure that depicts a free standing and decontextualized wall, just like the sculpture’s title designates. This representation of an isolated mundane object is somewhat difficult to recognize at first since previous notions of the term ‘wall’ are associated with the presence of four partitions that subsequently form a space, which is not evident in this circumstance. Additionally, rigidness and compaction characterize this universal structure, hence impeding the idea of motion. 
    Lastly, concerning the formal analysis, Wall is constructed based on the three dimensional volume of a rectangular solid. Therefore, the sculpture has a uniform structure since it remains with the same configuration when viewed from different angles. The sculpture’s steel surface is painted uniquely in black, which in addition to the solid’s geometric, blank and barren qualities highlights the influence of minimalism. Such aesthetic combined with the utilized medium resemble an industrial impression in regards to the sculpture as a whole.
Wall, 1964 by Tony Smith exposes the relationship between fine art and architecture through the use of a sculptural approach that depicts an urban and daily object. The solid’s extreme simplicity and monochromatic appearance implies a relation towards minimalist style, which is also evident throughout the exhibit. 
            
            -----
            
            Olivier Mosset is generally known for his large monochromatic paintings characterized by an uninflected color surface. However, such consistency of using unicolor is quite deceiving since the paintings are, in fact, based on a duo chromatic and even trichromatic color scheme. In other words, Mosset’s initially single applied color turns out to be a multiplicity of colors layered underneath each other and only noticeable when carefully looking at the side edges of the canvas. The vast majority of his paintings generate controversy to the viewers, whom skeptically comment among each other “how is this even considered art?” Needless to say, this thought provoking claim can be best addressed by referencing modern artist Craig Damrauer’s piece, which clarifies the issue through a simple equation: “Modern Art = I Could Do That + Yeah, But You Didn’t.”
