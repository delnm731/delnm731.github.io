        <p>Conceptual art can be summarized in three main ideas: <italic>(1) the content is more important than the form, (2) the message should be timely, </italic>and <italic>(3) relate to present socio-political occurrences.</italic> All of which are evident in On Kawara's highly recognized <italic>Today</italic> series also known as "Date Paintings." Documenting the following exhibition was rather challenging since there was no photography allowed.<br><br>
            
            <a class="link" href="http://blogs-cdn.guggenheim.org/2015/04/checklist_On-Kawara_Silence-exh_ph101_1024.jpg">JULY 20, 1969 “MAN WALKS ON MOON”</a> is a painting started and finished on the same day (July 20th 1969) by Japanese conceptual artist On Kawara, and belongs to the <italic>Today</italic> (1966-2013) series also referred to as “Date paintings.” The painting, executed in acrylic on canvas, roughly measures 61x89 inches and portrays a carefully hand drawn date that reads: JULY 20, 1969. The background color of the canvas appears to be either black or a dark hue of gray, whereas the sans-serif script is white and horizontally oriented. Although the canvas remains unframed, the general condition of the paining appears to be whole and undamaged. In addition to the canvas, the artist included a separate cardboard storage box with a local newspaper clipping on the inside that relates to the depicted date. Such box is set flat on a mounted shelf, which is surrounded by a glass casing that extends along the wall.<br><br>
            
            When compared to the other canvases that also belong to the <italic>Today</italic> series, <a class="link" href="http://blogs-cdn.guggenheim.org/2015/04/checklist_On-Kawara_Silence-exh_ph101_1024.jpg">JULY 20, 1969 “MAN WALKS ON MOON”</a>, in conjunction with <a class="link" href="http://blogs-cdn.guggenheim.org/2015/04/checklist_On-Kawara_Silence-exh_ph101_1024.jpg">JULY 16, 1969 “MAN WALKS ON MOON”</a> and <a class="link" href="http://blogs-cdn.guggenheim.org/2015/04/checklist_On-Kawara_Silence-exh_ph101_1024.jpg">JULY 21, 1969 “MAN WALKS ON MOON”</a>, become the center of attention due to their immense size. These particular dates were worthy of supersizing since the paintings illustrate one of mankind’s greatest achievements–landing and walking on the moon. Additionally, Kawara was fascinated with space-time continuum and translated his location through orthography in his <italic>Today</italic> series paintings. For instance, according to the syntax pertaining to JULY 20, 1969, Kawara was situated in either United States or Belize. But, after corroborating with the content inside the cardboard box that belongs to this specific painting, the viewer can affirm that Kawara was in New York, United States at the time of production since it contains a newspaper clipping from The New York Times.<br><br>
            
            Very much like Sol Lewitt’s visual practice of extreme reductivism, On Kawara also <italic>“transforms the work’s spectator into a reader: in the act of pronouncing the information inscribed on the canvas, [and ultimately] the viewing relationship becomes a performative reader relationship.”</italic> This performative model can be evident throughout the <italic>Today</italic> paintings, since they provide an inscription of dates that the reader automatically understands as a linguistic definition, as opposed to purely visual forms. Many have criticized Kawara’s paintings by claiming that they are just letters and numbers, but Lewitt explains in Sentences of Conceptual Art, <italic>“#16. If words are used, and they proceed from ideas about art, then they are art and not literature, numbers are not mathematics.”</italic>  In other words, this method of recording time through typographical letters and numbers relates to a greater concept that consists on the artist and viewer possibly sharing a date on which they both lived. <br><br>
            
            On Kawara was part of a phenomenal group of conceptual artists, yet his work differs from the rest since it is visually opposed to the primary principle of conceptual art–rejection of aesthetics. Arguably, he spent as much time formulating a concept as he did developing techniques, hence providing an overall cohesive, incessant, and practically sublime art collection. Nonetheless, the emotional force of conceptual art remains embedded in all of On Kawara’s artworks where each painting is a catalyst. Additionally, the artist disregards the conventional way of appreciating beauty through representation and demonstrates that ideas can be beautiful too. Thereby, this high concept exhibition based on experiencing consciousness essentially embodies one of LeWitt’s renowned theories, <italic>“Successful art changes our understating of the conventions by altering our perceptions.”</italic> <br><br>
