            <b>MDN:</b> Tell me about yourself.<br><br>

            <b>KW:</b> I don't like these kinds of questions. I think describing myself in such concrete terms stifles growth, but I'll try:             <br>

            I talk back to people,especially men, a lot. I spend the vast majority of my time neglecting any and all responsibility         regarding things that aren't my studio practice. I wear a lot of lipstick, mostly red. I only know of people who adore me and of people who hate me: there isn't a lot of middle ground in my life.  I'm comfortable in my own skin and I don't care what most people think of me.<br>              <br>

            <b>MDN:</b> How old are you?<br><br>

            <b>KW:</b> I'm 20, I turn 21 in November.<br><br>

            <b>MDN:</b> Where did you grow up?<br><br>

            <b>KW:</b> I grew up in the Silicon Valley, but I've spent a lot of time in the Midwest and on the East Coast.<br><br>

            <b>MDN:</b> What is your current major?<br><br>

            <b>KW:</b> I'm a Painting and Drawing major at California College of the Arts in the San Francisco Bay Area. I did my first year of undergrad at Parsons. Had I stayed at Parsons, I probably would have majored in Communication Design because of the strong program, but I don't know if I would have been happy. I don't like spending a lot of time in front of computers–I like to get my hands dirty.<br><br>

            <b>MDN:</b> In your opinion, what’s integral to the work of an artist?<br><br>

            <b>KW:</b> Passion is really important to me. I have trouble engaging in activities I'm not passionate about. I toss paintings aside when I get bored– if they don't interest me, who will be interested in them?  I used to make work in one six hour sitting, but I'm trying to break away from that. I find it crucial to take time away from your work, whether it be going outside and taking a walk with my boyfriend, or working on multiple pieces at once. I'm trying to spend more time on my work as a whole.<br><br>

            I think watching what you consume on a cultural level is really critical as well– something that was said by a professor that stuck to me was the whole "what you put in your mind finds a way into what you create", thing. I don't watch a whole lot of TV. The social media platforms I use are ad-free. I don't know what movies are in theaters right now. I read a lot of books; I go to a lot of galleries and museums. I go to concerts if I really love the artist–the two sounds that scare me the most are screaming and clapping, which are obviously unavoidable at concerts.<br><br>

            <b>MDN:</b> What types of art do you prefer?<br><br>

            <b>KW:</b> People often ask me if I like painting or drawing better. I'm generally ambivalent on that subject, but lately I like to blur the lines between the two with mixed media pieces (crayon and watercolor, ink and acrylic, oil and pastel). My favorite things to make art with are oil paint, watercolor, and ink . I just bought a shit-ton of colored pencils, though. Sculpture is okay if it's done really well, but it isn't what gets me off. I used to be really into photography as a (troubled) teenager, but it never manages to keep my interest for more than a few months at a time. Instagram is okay–I mostly use it as a way to instantly validate myself, the way most 20 somethings do.<br><br>

            I'm obsessed with painting. I like looking at paintings. I want to eat paintings.<br><br> 

            I like German artists a lot. I like portraiture and landscapes.<br><br>

            I like writing. I read a lot, so naturally I like to write. This summer I'm going to do a project where I paint all of my ex lovers and write them letters.<br><br> 

            I draw a fair amount on my tablet. I don't like most digital art though–it's too illustrative.<br><br> 

            <b>MDN:</b> What is your primary field of interest?<br><br> 

            <b>KW:</b> Mixed media works on paper and canvas. objectifying men.<br><br> 

            <b>MDN:</b> What is your method/How do you work?<br><br> 

            I paint my imaginary friends (lots of angsty girls) or paint men I've slept with.<br><br> 

            The girls i don't use any reference for, but if it's a man, i usually use reference/paint from life.<br><br> 

            I paint people i have relationships with, imagined or real.<br><br>  

            I focus a lot on color. I like my work to be loose and gestural.<br><br> 

            I'm trying to start painting about my feelings and insides. I don't paint about myself as much as I talk about myself and I would like to change that. Expect more self portraits and still lives in the future.<br><br> 

            I try to explore what i'm feeling and how I make people feel.<br><br> 

            <b>MDN:</b> When did you start?<br><br> 

            <b>KW:</b> Portraits, in 2013. I've drawn my whole life.<br><br> 

            <b>MDN:</b> How has your practice changed over time?<br><br> 

            <b>KW:</b> My work is more personal. my work has gotten grittier. My work used to be pretty and meant to please people. It's gotten less "conceptual" and more biographical.<br><br> 

            <b>MDN:</b> What themes do you pursue?<br><br> 

            <b>KW:</b> Relationships, feelings, struggles, unrest.<br><br> 

            I like to make people feel uncomfortable. I like when people ask questions.<br><br>  

            <b>MDN:</b> What is more important in your artwork: composition or subject matter? Or both?<br><br> 
 
            <b>KW:</b> Subject matter.<br><br> 

            <b>MDN:</b> Why?<br><br> 

            <b>KW:</b> If I painted strangers my work would be less meaningful. The psychological factor would be gone.<br><br> 

            Composition is important too, but I would rather have a stronger subject matter since my relationships with the subjects are critical to the work itself. I only paint people I love or people I hate.<br><br> 
 
            <b>MDN:</b> Is there a particular reason for constantly depicting human figures? What does it mean?<br><br> 

            <b>KW:</b> That's a really good question that I probably need a couple of more years to figure out the answer to.<br><br> 

            I used to hate the figure. i used to render somewhat realistically and it make me sick. i'm trying to incorporate that back into my studio practice, though–get tight again.<br><br> 

            <b>MDN:</b> What are three artists you’d like to be compared to?<br><br> 

            <b>KW:</b> Drawings: Schiele, Klimt, Kokoschka<br><br> 

            Paintings: Freud, dumas, Kokoschka. I like the way freud renders flesh. I like the way kokoschka develops form with color. I get compared to kokoschka a lot at school, and that makes me happy.<br><br> 

            <b>MDN:</b> Where do you want to go with this?<br><br> 

            <b>KW:</b> I want to draw every day until the day I die. I want to get an MFA. I want to do some teaching at the collegiate level. I want to make people feel things with my marks and words. I want to push it as far as i can take it. I want to be successful, but i am not quite sure what that means.<br><br> 

            <b>MDN:</b> Why art?<br><br> 

            <b>KW:</b> It makes me less prone to outbursts. It gives me a purpose. <br><br>
