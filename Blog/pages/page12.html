        <p>In 2014, Kevin LaGrandeur coined the term <italic>“post-humanism”</italic> to describe that condition in which humans and intelligent technology are becoming increasingly intertwined. He also describes three main characteristics comprised by such terminology: (1) posthuman’s focus on information and systems theories (cybernetics), (2) the posthuman’s consequent, primary relationship to digital technology, and (3) the posthuman’s emphasis on systems (such as humans) as distributed entities–that is, as systems comprised of, and entangled with, other systems. I feel that this concept is at the core of The New Museum’s Triennial: “Surround Audience” and is particularly evident Daniel Steegmann Mangrané’s Phantom (kingdom of all the animals and all the beasts is my name), 2014-15. How does such artist alter and enhance the human visual perception through technology? And, in doing so, accentuates contemporary tensions that relate to the global environment and ecological systems?<br><br>
            
As opposed to traditional art viewing, where canvases hang against the walls, such three-dimensional artwork is located in a site-specific space that allows the viewer to explore the whereabouts. Daniel Steegmann Mangrané presents a practically empty space surrounded by what seem to be four monitor cameras located closer to the upper half of the walls, in addition to two circles taped on the floor–a small circle contained within a larger circle–which denote some sense of boundary. Yet, the main focus of his piece is the dangling headset from the ceiling that one must wait in line in order to use. While the viewer anticipates for his/her turn, a sense of excitement immediately takes over by watching the participant with the headset walk around the space while attempting to look in all directions at the same time and often extend their arms as if they were to touch something or someone. After the impatient and almost never-ending wait, I finally strapped the weird-looking goggles around my head to discover nothing but disappointment at first glance. The headset transports the viewer to, what in my opinion looked like, an outdated and pixelated black and white virtual landscape with no audio. However, I was still amused not by the subject matter itself but rather by the medium the artist used, which made me reflect and acknowledge the potential of this illusive way of viewing art. Consequently asking myself, could this be the artwork of the future?<br><br>
            
            I usually enjoy and understand the artworks after a series of documentation regarding the artist, his background and practice. However, this was not the case during my first visit to the New Museum’s Triennial since I followed the professor’s approach of simply interpreting the works without any previous influence. After conducting a brief research on both artists, I returned to the New Museum for a second attempt that aimed to sympathize with the piece. Going back to Mangrané’s work, I often wondered why did he create something as traditional as a landscape, when using such advanced technology that relates to virtual reality? I soon discovered that although the artist was born in Barcelona, Spain, 1977, Mangrané lives and works in Rio de Janeiro;  therefore, the subject matter is clearly influenced by the artist’s country of residency since Mangrané’s virtual-reality headset transposes the viewer into a representation of the rapidly disappearing Mata Atlantica rainforest in Brazil.<br><br>
            
            After attending to The New Museum’s Triennial, the title “Surround Audience” becomes an understatement for “Sensory Chaos,” which is another characteristic embodied by the artwork. In regards to Mangrané, “the consideration of the viewer’s perceptual experience is paramount to his practice.”  Thereby, the artist challenges the optical field by creating a virtual rainforest stimulation that has the quality of a star-lit sky, but one that can be passed through and perceived at many angles, not merely observed.<br><br>
