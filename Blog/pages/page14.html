<italic>“Pop is everything art hasn’t been for the last two decades. It’s basically a U-turn back to a representational visual communication, moving at a break-away speed.”</italic> –Robert Indiana.<br><br>  

32 Campbell’s Soup Cans (1962) by Andy Warhol shatters the traditional standards of art-making by differing from the often-pursued concept of ‘originality.’ In doing so, Warhol introduces innovative symbolism, concepts and techniques that transform ordinary objects into extraordinary masterpieces, which thoroughly impacted both the art world and popular culture during the late 20th century.<br><br>
            
Pop Art, a movement that developed in the early 1960s, responded to Abstract Expressionism and its obsession with the ‘uniqueness’ of its subject matter. Subsequent to World War II, Abstract Expressionism–also referred to as The New York School or Action Painting–developed around <italic>“the churning inner torment of the artist to ‘express’ himself.”</italic> Methods such as dripping, smearing, and splashing paint were used by Abstract Expressionist artists in order to create unrecognizable subjects, which aimed to illustrate the artists’ reflection and mood.<br><br>
            
In response to this movement, a group of concerned activists, thinkers, and artists came together to overturn the stereotypical characters comprised by the art field, which were often described as repressive and conformist—this work marked the beginning of the Pop Art movement. Art critic and philosopher Arthur C. Danto explains that the <italic></italic>“artists who made this turn were not simply reacting to Abstract Expressionism; they were revolutionizing the concept of art. They were pressing against a boundary.”</italic> The constant fascination with the ‘sublime’ in preceding art movements was about to end with Pop Art’s introduction of commonplace objects and everyday life icons.<br><br>
    
    32 Campbell’s Soup Cans is among Andy Warhol’s most significant masterpieces–often associated with the birth of the Pop Art movement. Such piece was first exhibited in 1962 in Los Angeles, which <italic>“transformed him into an overnight sensation... It was his first one-person exhibition organized by Irving Blum, the legendary and visionary director of the Ferus Gallery.”</italic> The thirty-two canvases were displayed resting against a narrow shelf mounted along a wall, drawing resemblance to the ubiquitous notion of grocery store shelves. Warhol’s concept of transforming everyday items into extraordinary artworks gained popularity throughout the decade and forever changed the culture of the art world. Scholars of his work explain that through the magnification of everyday imagery, Warhol criticized the bourgeois mores and values that characterize modern society, causing his audience to realize <italic>“that the idea behind the soup can is more important than the actual appearance of the object.”</italic><br><br>
    
Warhol rejected “high art” and “academic art” which frequently encompassed the themes of morality, mythology, aristocracy and classic history—rarely incorporating objects of contemporary culture. By using mundane objects, such as advertisement, comic books, and magazines, as “fine art,” Warhol was able to subsequently <italic>“demolish the critical and perceptual boundaries [that used to separate] ‘fine’ and ‘applied’ art.”</italic>  This concept of altering pre-existing imagery and turning it into one’s own artistic practice is commonly referred to as <italic>appropriation</italic>. Such use of imagery was fully developed by Warhol, as seen in 32 Campbell’s Soup Cans–an eight by four grid, based on 20 x 16 inch canvases that add up a total of 32 synthetic polymer paintings, which include a thin wooden frame. Although, all 32 canvases portray the well-known image of Campbell’s Soup can silkscreened on a white background, each can differs from one another because of the flavor inscribed on the label (i.e. Chicken Noodle Soup, Onion Soup, Tomato Soup, and so forth). Moreover, Warhol’s brand image artworks, borrowed from supermarket products, emphasized America’s progression into what he believed was a trademark commodity, represented through the his use of repetition, as seen in 32 Campbell’s Soup Cans:<br><br>
    
<italic>My image is a statement of the symbols of the harsh, impersonal products on which America is built today. It is a projection of everything that can be bought and sold, the practical but impermanent symbols that sustain us.</italic><br><br> 

Warhol’s use of commercial objects as the canvas’ subject relates to major shifts in both the art world and society in the 1960s. Danto explains that at the time, <italic>“everyone’s conception of art was of something spiritually rich that belonged in gold frames and that hung on museum walls, or in the mansions of the wealthy.”</italic> Warhol’s concept of Soup Cans revolutionized pre-established boundaries and understandings of the essence of ‘art.’<br><br>
    
Also, the idea of making art approachable to the audience reflects Warhol’s attempt to change people’s mindset by making a commentary about American society at the time: <italic>“[Warhol’s] art exposed the (…) crass commercial values of American culture.”</italic> As a matter of fact, Warhol explains this himself:<br><br>
    
<italic>What's great about this country is that America started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same things as the poorest. You can be watching TV and see Coca-Cola, and you know that the President drinks Coca-Cola, Liz Taylor drinks Coca-Cola, and just think, you can drink Coca-Cola, too. A Coke is a Coke and no amount of money can get you a better Coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking. All the Cokes are the same and all the Cokes are good. Liz Taylor knows it, the President knows it, the bum knows it, and you know it.</italic><br><br>
    
Warhol’s work not only revolutionized the visual arts conceptually, but mechanically, as well. His disregard for the idea of originality went beyond appropriation and included the production of multiples of work, but, above all, his work was based on adopting commercial methods like silk-screening as a medium to produce art. Warhol was one of the first artists that used silkscreen (also denoted as screen-printing) as a technique to create art; thus, making Campbell’s Soup Cans (1962) one of the first productions of this practice. By implementing such a mechanized approach to his artwork, Warhol wanted to convey how <italic>“the influence of the machine [has taken over] our everyday lives... all of his work in one way or another relates to the mass produced machine product, and consequently to marketing.”</italic> This relationship between the technique and artwork is also revealed in Warhol’s renown concept of ‘The Factory’ in which the artist <italic>“want[ed] his studio to be considered more of an ‘art factory’ than an artist’s studio in the traditional sense.”</italic><br><br>
    
Transforming mundane objects into focal points, using screen-printing as a means of production, and pioneering new concepts related to society’s crass commercial shift, make 32 Campbell’s Soup Cans a clear example of how Andy Warhol revolutionized the conventional standards of art making. Campbell’s Soup Cans not only marks a new beginning for the arts, it also comprises an in depth view of the artist’s progressive mindset; his constant questioning around what society considers meaningful led him to illustrate reality <italic>“he embodied a concept of life that embraced the values of an era that we are still living in. In certain ways he created an iconic image of what life was all about.”</italic><br><br>
